# Snake

As a little exercise, I decided that I would build each project (except for the last) in the article [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/), using a different language for each project. This is the 5<sup>th</sup> project in the article, built in Ruby. Before running, install the `json` and `colorize` packages.
